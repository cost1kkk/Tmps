# Topic: *SOLID Principles*

## Author: Baxanean Constantin

## Objectives:

* Study and understand the SOLID Principles.
* Choose a domain, define its main classes/models/entities and choose the appropriate instantiation mechanisms.
* Create a sample project that respects SOLID Principles.

## Main tasks:
* Choose an OO programming language and a suitable IDE or Editor (No frameworks/libs/engines allowed).

* Select a domain area for the sample project.

* Define the main involved classes and think about what instantiation mechanisms are needed.

* Respect SOLID Principles in your project.



## Theory:
The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely used in object-oriented programming. The SOLID acronym stands for:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
   - A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should have only one responsibility or job.
   - It encourages the separation of concerns, making classes more focused and easier to understand.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - You should be able to extend the behavior of a system without modifying its existing code.
   - Achieved through the use of interfaces, abstract classes, and polymorphism.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
   - It ensures that objects of a superclass can be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the program's functionality.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
   - A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
   - It suggests that it's better to have several small, specific interfaces rather than a large, general-purpose one.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
   - Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
   - It encourages the use of dependency injection, inversion of control, and programming to interfaces.
