# Topic: *SOLID Principles*

## Author: Baxanean Constantin

## Objectives:

* Study and understand the SOLID Principles.
* Choose a domain, define its main classes/models/entities and choose the appropriate instantiation mechanisms.
* Create a sample project that respects SOLID Principles.

## Main tasks:
* Choose an OO programming language and a suitable IDE or Editor (No frameworks/libs/engines allowed).

* Select a domain area for the sample project.

* Define the main involved classes and think about what instantiation mechanisms are needed.

* Respect SOLID Principles in your project.



## Theory:
&ensp; SOLID is a set of five object-oriented design principles intended to make software designs more maintainable, flexible, and easy to understand. The acronym stands for Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle. Each principle addresses a specific aspect of software design, such as the organization of responsibilities, the handling of dependencies, and the design of interfaces. By following these principles, software developers can create more modular, testable, and reusable code that is easier to modify and extend over time. These principles are widely accepted and adopted in the software development community and can be applied to any object-oriented programming language.


## Implementation

&ensp; The project is a simple library management system implemented in Python, and it adheres to the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. The project simulates a basic library system with features to add books and users and list them.

## Output:
```
Books in the library:
Mr Mercedes by Stephen King (ISBN: 978-0567839021)
The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (ISBN: 978-0743273565)
To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee (ISBN: 978-0446310789)

Users of the library:
User: john_doe (john@example.com)

## Conclusions / Screenshots / Results
&ensp; In summary, this project demonstrates SOLID principles by keeping classes focused on specific responsibilities, enabling easy extension without modification, and using abstractions to reduce dependencies between components. It provides a basic foundation that can be expanded upon while maintaining good design principles.
